<h1>Jam Rules</h1>

<div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
        <legend>General</legend>
        <p>
            These rules are laid down to allow a fun, entertaining and fair event
            for everyone. They are subject for iteration and improvement. We appreciate your feedback!
        </p>

        <p>
            The admins may remove games if they do not conform to these
            regulations.
        </p>

        <legend>Procedure</legend>
        <p>
            Every game jam can be divided into the following states:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Announcement</dt><dd> The theme is announced</dd>
            <dt>Idea pitch</dt><dd> After some minutes the stage is yours. You can pitch your idea and search for team members.</dd>
            <dt>Programming</dt><dd> Start to work with your team and get things done.</dd>
            <dt>Packaging</dt><dd> About 1 hour before the deadline you should start package your game, upload screens etc. to the page and be ready to present the game to the audience</dd>
            <dt>Voting</dt><dd> While everyone presents the games you can vote for the games and the committee will announce the winners of the jam.</dd>
            <dt>Finished</dt><dd>We hope you had an awesome weekend and we wish you to come home safely. See you next time!</dd>
        </ul>

        <legend>Theme</legend>
        <p>
            The theme will be randomly chosen from suggestions from the
            previous jams, from you and from the committee. It will be announced
            at the beginning of the contest. Everyone may suggest a theme.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants who have registered with the option to receive
            email notifications will also receive the theme by email.
        </p>
        <p>
            All games must have something to do with the theme. We won't
            be fussy about that, though, so it's ok if the theme is not the
            main thing of your project, but it has to be visible.
            Browse the <a href="{{ url_for('jams') }}">list of jams</a> to see what
            has been chosen as theme previously.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <legend>Artwork</legend>
        <p>
            Freely available, external artwork may be used as long as a source
            is provided in the posted game. The artwork authors should be
            credited. This applies to sounds and graphics likewise.
        </p>

        <legend>Cross-platform</legend>
        <p>
            Making a cross-platform game is strongly encouraged. However, you
            are not required to make your game cross-platform in order to
            participate. Be aware that the community does not consist only of
            Windows users. A user may downvote your game if it can't run on the
            user's platform.
        </p>

        <legend>Libraries/Engines</legend>
        <p>
            Any freely available external libraries may be used for your game.
            The library doesn't need to be <a title="Wikipedia: Free and open source software"
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software" target="_blank">
            FOSS</a>. Proprietary engines like
            <a href="http://www.udk.com/" target="_blank">UDK</a> and <a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>
            are alright.
        </p>

        <legend>Snippets/personal Code</legend>
        <p>
            If you want to reuse pre-existing code of yours, it must have been
            available in source form for the public to see a fair amount of time
            prior to the start of the contest. The same goes for random snippets
            of code.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <legend>Source control</legend>
        <p>
            Use of a publicly accessible source control system is encouraged
            but not required. <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>
            is recommended. To make this clear, you are not required to share
            your source but again, you are encouraged to do so.
        </p>

        <legend>Team size</legend>
        <p>
            You can work in teams. The team size is unlimited. Your team can include coders, artists, game
            designers, composers, anyone.
        </p>

        <legend>Time limit</legend>
        <p>
            The time limit is stated in the jam details. It starts with the announcement of the theme.
            Any work after the deadline is packaging only. Nothing else allowed. Please
            ensure that you already started packaging your game before the deadline because we start
            directly after the deadline with the game presentations.
        </p>
