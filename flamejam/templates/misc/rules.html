		<h2>Cross-platform</h2>

		<p>Making a cross-platform game is strongly encouraged. However, you are not required to make your game cross-platform in order to participate. Be aware that the community does not consist only of Windows users. A user may downvote your game if it can't run on the user's platform. </p>

		<h2>Theme</h2>

		<p>The theme will be randomly chosen from suggestions from the previous jams, from you and from the committee. It will be announced at the beginning of the contest. Everyone may suggest a theme.<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			Participants who have registered with the option to receive email notifications will also receive the theme by email.<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			All games must have something to do with the theme. We won't be fussy about that, though, so it's ok if the theme is not the main thing of your project, but it has to be visible. Browse the list of jams to see what has been chosen as theme previously.
