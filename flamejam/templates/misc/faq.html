        <h2>What is a gamejam?</h2>
        <p>
            A game jam is an event during which all participants create
            games according to a provided theme within a short amount of
            time (usually between two days to a week). Check out the
            <a href="{{ url_for('rules') }}#procedure">rules page</a> for
            details on the procedure.
        </p>

        <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Everyone.</b> It is as simple as that.
        </p>

        <h2>What type of games are created?</h2>
        <p>
            Difficult to say. We want to achieve a wide range of different
            game types. Games are also rated for their <i>innovative factor</i>,
            and some games submitted have unique gameplay mechanisms. Of course
            there are always some games of the main video game genres, but
            that depends on the theme and the creativity of the authors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have the courage to try something completely new. It's worth it!

        <h2>How do I make a game?</h2>
        <p>
            Never did it before? No problem! The game jams are a learning
            effort, so newbies are also welcome. But to make sure you will
            have something playable within this short amount of time you
            should prepare for the event. Tips for greenhorns:

            <b>For programmers:</b>
            <ul class="normal">
                <li>First learn programming, then game development. Many people
                think this is the same, but actually there is a huge difference.
                It's good to know how to program, but making a game is much
                more. You also need art, maths, a story, a lot of creativity
                and a good time management.</li>
                <li>Find an easy programming language, framework or engine. You
                probably do not want to start of coding C on OpenGL level.
                Find something that suits you. You are even allowed to use
                game creation software where you only have to drag 'n' drop
                your components together.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>For everyone:</b>
            <ul class="normal">
                <li>Team up! While working with other people who are more
                experienced than you you learn a lot faster than alone. There are
                lots of skilled game developers here, just ask.</li>
                <li>Join as an artist. Every game needs some art, and every
                programmer loves artists. You will contribute an important
                part to a game project, even if you don't write a single line
                of code.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Where can I find resources?</h2>
        <p>
            We compiled <a href="{{ url_for('links') }}#resources">this nice list</a> for you. But always make sure to check
            the licence!
        </p>

        <h2>I need an artist / programmer</h2>
        <p>
            You can find other participants onsite or on this website. We will do a idea pitch after the theme announcement and try to connect everyone with a existing or a new team. Feel free to ask uns anywhere and anytime if you need support.
